  Libassuan
 ===========

This is the IPC library used by GnuPG 1.9, GPGME and a few other
packages.  It used to be included with the latter packages but we
decided to make your life not too easy and separated it out to a
stand alone library.

It is currently not intended to be used as a shared library.
